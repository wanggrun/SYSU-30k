DeepFashion2 is a comprehensive fashion dataset. It contains 491K diverse images of 13 popular clothing categories from both 
commercial shopping stores and consumers. It totally has 801K clothing clothing items, where each item in an image is labeled 
with scale, occlusion, zoom-in, viewpoint, category, style, bounding box, dense landmarks and per-pixel mask.There are also 873K Commercial-Consumer clothes pairs.\
The dataset is split into a training set (391K images), a validation set (34k images), and a test set (67k images).\
Examples of DeepFashion2 are shown in Figure 1.

*<sub>From (1) to (4), each row represents clothes images with different variations. At each row, we partition the images into two groups, the left three columns represent clothes from commercial stores, while the right three columns are from customers.In each group, the three images indicate three levels of difficulty with respect to the corresponding variation.Furthermore, at each row, the items in these two groups of images are from the same clothing identity but from two different domains, that is, commercial and customer.The items of the same identity may have different styles such as color and printing.Each item is annotated with landmarks and masks.*
